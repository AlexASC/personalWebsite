         Hello, my name is Alex Guataipu. I am a Hispanic-American, I currently attend Newtown Highschool
         and I plan on going to Brandeis University with a major in computer science. I have taken Martial 
         Arts for about 8 years straight. It was a great experience to be a part of that and I changed a lot
         with the responsibility I was given. The summer of my Junior Year of Highschool was my best year of
         highschool. I was able to get into the oportunity Network which is a six year program which supports
         students for their last two years of highschool and throught their 4 years of college. Due to my 
         acceptance of this program I was able to apply to internships and I managed to get accepted into All
         Star Code. All Star Code is an internship program which taught coding and other essential life and 
         work skills during the summer.
